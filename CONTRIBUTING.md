# Contributing to Vapor Core

If you found a mistake or think of a cool new feature, please [create an issue](https://github.com/vapor/core/issues/new) or, if you want to implement it yourself, [fork this repo](https://github.com/vapor/core/fork) and open a Pull Request!

We'll take a look as soon as we can.

Thanks!

### NOTE:
During the development of Vapor 4, this package will be split up into multiple smaller ones. For example [codable-kit](https://github.com/vapor-community/codable-kit) and [nio-kit](https://github.com/vapor-community/nio-kit). If you create a PR/issue here, please be so kind to also open it in the "new" repo.
Current list of existing repos Core will be split into:
- [codable-kit](https://github.com/vapor-community/codable-kit) (Parts of Core & Bits)
- [nio-kit](https://github.com/vapor-community/nio-kit) (Async module)
